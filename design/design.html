        <h3> Statement of purpose : </h3>
        <p style="font-weight:normal;">
            This document is a technical design document for our civic 
            engagement map. It provides a description of our architectural
             design, the Model View Controller, our plan for future changes 
             in requirements, some explanation on our decision to create an 
             online tool using javascript, html, css and php, and our UML
             diagram. 
        </p> 
    </div>
    <h3> Architectural style: </h3>
	<p style="font-weight:normal;">
	The architecture that we are planning to use is the Model-View-Controller pattern. We chose MVC since it divides the application into three logical components that makes the most sense for this system. We envisioned a model that will contain information for the bubbles, a view that displays the map, and a controller that interacts with both the model and the view to manage interactions with the user.
	</p>
    <h3> Unresolved issues: </h3>
    <p style="font-weight:normal;"> We will be creating an online system based
    on the requirement that this will be displayed on websites and quick
    for users to use. We will be using an official set of data while allowing 
    users to add local data for their personal views and to submit data to be
    reviewed and potentially added to the official dataset. 
    <h3> Plan for future change: </h3>
    Our design is focused on modularity, splitting up our map application
    into focused objects, in order to plan for change. We have abstracted
    our classes so that a change the implementation of one class does not
    necessarily affect it's relationship with other classes. With the MVC
    architecture, we have extensibility in allowing new capabilities 
    without causing changes to our current ones. 
    <h3> Implementation language: </h3>
    <p style="font-weight:normal;"> We will be using javascript, html, css 
    and php for our civic engagement map. We want a dynamic web application in
    order to follow the requirements that our map will be available on websites. 
    Javascript has frameworks in order to build our map. We will allow users
    to apply filters and submit forms that will update the data displayed on the 
    map, and these languages in an MVC architect will allow us to pull
    data from a database, filter and display to the users. 
    <h3> UML Diagram: </h3>
    <img src="MVC.png"></img>
    <p style="font-weight:normal;"> This diagram represents the highest-level view of our MVC framework. Later
    diagrams go into more detail and even tweak these three classes as needed to meet the
    requirements of the system. </p>
    
    <h3> MapView Design </h3>
    <img src="view.png"></img>
    <p style="font-weight:normal;"> This diagram shows the sub-design of
    the view tier of our architecture. </p>

    <h3> MapModel Design </h3>
    <img src="view.png"></img>
    <p style="font-weight:normal;"> This diagram shows the sub-design of
    the model tier of our architecture. </p>
    
    <h3> Filter Model Design </h3>
    <img src="Filter.png"></img> 
    <p style="font-weight:normal;"> This diagram gives a more fleshed out
    version of what classes should be included to allow the filters to sort
    through the database and change which bubbles are included in the model.</p>

    <h3> MapController Design </h3>
    <p style="font-weight:normal;"> At some point, we have to stop designing and start
    coding, so, we leave the Controller UML out and simply state that there should be a class
    for any view object we wish to interact with and methods and attributes to allow a
    controller object to determine whether user events apply to itself, and based on the
    information in that event, react by modifying the model appropriately and telling the
    MapView to check the model and display the results. </p>
