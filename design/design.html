        <h3> Statement of purpose : </h3>
        <p style="font-weight:normal;">
            This document is a technical design document for our civic 
            engagement map. It provides a description of our architectural
             design, the Model View Controller, our plan for future changes 
             in requirements, some explanation on our decision to create an 
             online tool using javascript, html, css and php, and our UML
             diagram. 
        </p> 
    </div>
    <h3> Architectural style: </h3>
    <h3> Unresolved issues: </h3>
    <p style="font-weight:normal;"> We will be creating an online system based
    on the requirement that this will be displayed on websites and quick
    for users to use. We will be using an official set of data while allowing 
    users to add local data for their personal views and to submit data to be
    reviewed and potentially added to the official dataset. 
    <h3> Plan for future change: </h3>
    Our design is focused on modularity, splitting up our map application
    into focused objects, in order to plan for change. We have abstracted
    our classes so that a change the implementation of one class does not
    necessarily affect it's relationship with other classes. With the MVC
    architecture, we have extensibility in allowing new capabilities 
    without causing changes to our current ones. 
    <h3> Implementation language: </h3>
    <p style="font-weight:normal;"> We will be using javascript, html, css 
    and php for our civic engagement map. We want a dynamic web application in
    order to follow the requirements that our map will be available on websites. 
    Javascript has frameworks in order to build our map. We will allow users
    to apply filters and submit forms that will update the data displayed on the 
    map, and these languages in an MVC architect will allow us to pull
    data from a database, filter and display to the users.
