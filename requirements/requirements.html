        <h3> Statement of purpose : </h3>
        <p style="font-weight:normal;">
            On February 17, 2015, 7 software teams met in a classroom to interview Andrea Grazzini
            using a prepared list of questions. Following the interview, our team, The Outsourcers,
            met in Room B on the Third Floor of Pickler Memorial Library on February 21, 2015 to
            create this document, a list of requirements for the software project based on the
            answers Andrea gave to our questions during the interview. This document will precisely
            define the software project, a bubble map showing civic engagement gaps in the United
            States, from the perspective of the developer to ensure that the developer's perspective
            matches the client's.
