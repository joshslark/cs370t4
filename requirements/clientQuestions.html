        <h3> Statement of purpose : </h3>
        <p style="font-weight:normal;">
            This document was created to formulate a list of
            questions for Andrea Grazzini that will be used during our interview with
            her on Tuesday, February 17, 2015. Our team, The Outsourcers, met in 
            Room G on the Second Floor of Pickler Memorial Library on February 10, 2015 to 
            discuss and organize questions we have about her idea for a software 
            project: a bubble map of civic engagement gaps in the United States. With
            the answers to these questions, we plan to formulate a requirements document
            that details exactly what is expected from the software system.
